 > - To make the text show you'll have to install this blocklist. You can also checkout my [custom script](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olivertzeng/dotfiles/master/ublocklist.txt&title=Oliver Tzeng's Custom Blocklist). But [here](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olivertzeng/DougDougGo/main/dougdouggo.txt&title=DougDougGo Blocklist) is the most basic script to hide duckduckgo's annoyances for basic addon functionality.

## Thanks to
 - DougDoug for inspirement
 - MagicJin being a tester, a supporter, an artist who made the extension icon, and a nice guy who makes DougDougify(and MrBeastify as
   well!)

## Disclamer
 - This project has nothing to do with Duck Duck Go, Inc.
 - I won't make a Chrome version for now because I don't want to pay for 5 dollars just to support
   the platform I don't use. You are free to rehost it on the Chrome Extension Store as long as you
   credit my name Oliver Tzeng.

**Issues and suggestions are welcomed**
